## **MindNotes_Microservices**

### **Description**

MindNotes_Microservices is a microservices-based mental health application designed to provide various features aimed at helping individuals manage their mental well-being. The application is composed of several distinct microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality within the broader system.

The project uses a combination of Spring Boot for the backend services and React for the frontend, all containerized with Docker. This monorepo structure houses both backend services and frontend code, enabling seamless development, deployment, and management of the entire application.

### **Microservices:**

- **Login Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Letters Service**: Allows users to write and save letters for self-expression and reflection.
- **Coping with Services**: Provides resources and strategies to cope with stress, anxiety, and mental health challenges.
- **Self Discovery Service**: A quiz-based service for self-reflection, offering users personalized insights based on their answers.
- **SelfHelp Service**: Offers access to various self-help resources and tools.

### **Frontend:**
The frontend is built using **React** and communicates with the backend via API calls to provide a seamless user experience. It includes features such as crisis management, self-discovery quizzes, and user-generated letters and affirmations.

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Spring Boot** for backend services
- **React** for the frontend
- **Docker** for containerization
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for data storage (based on your setup)
- **Jenkins** for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration and horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA)
- **Docker Compose** for local development environments (optional as Kubernetes replaces it)
