      # === Frontend Path (No Rewrite Needed) ===
      # This rule MUST come AFTER the more specific /api/* rules.
      # The rewrite annotation above does NOT apply directly here because the path regex
      # used in the rewrite target (/api/service(/|$)(.*)) won't match "/".

        # Note: Because the main rewrite target uses $2 from the *matched* path's regex,
        # when "/" is matched by /()(.*), $2 will contain the original path "/",
        # effectively sending "/" to the frontend, which is usually correct.
